					<h2>About</h2>

						{' '}
						I'm the rockstar coder who can seamlessly switch between
						debugging bugs and headbanging to some hardcore tunes.
						With a heart that beats in sync with extreme music, I
						find my coding rhythm in the chaotic beats and intricate
						melodies. My coding journey is a lot like a FromSoftware
						game â€“ challenging, rewarding, and occasionally
						sprinkled with a touch of frustration, but I always
						level up in the end.
					</p>

					<p>
						When I'm not typing away lines of code, you'll probably
						catch me in an epic battle of Magic: The Gathering or
						diving into the strategic world of Runeterra. The thrill
						of outsmarting opponents in both coding challenges and
						card games keeps my adrenaline pumping. In this digital
						realm, I'm the sorcerer of syntax, the maestro of metal,
						and the tactician of the trading card battlefield. So,
						whether I'm crafting lines of code or crafting the
						perfect deck, I'm always on a quest for the next
						exciting adventure.{' '}
