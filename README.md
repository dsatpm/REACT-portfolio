## Overview

Welcome to my React Portfolio, a showcase of my skills and projects. Built using popular React libraries and tools, this portfolio provides a dynamic and interactive way to explore my work.


## Technologies Used

- [React](https://react.dev/): React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable UI components, making it easier to manage and update complex user interfaces.
- [React DOM](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom): Provides the DOM-specific methods necessary for rendering React components. It works in conjunction with React to update and manage the DOM efficiently.
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): A library that provides a collection of popular icons for use in React applications. It allows you to easily integrate icons from various icon libraries, enhancing the visual appeal of your components.
- [React Scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app): A set of scripts and configurations used by Create React App, a popular tool for quickly setting up and bootstrapping React applications. It abstracts complex configurations, making it easier to start a new React project.
- [React Scroll](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll): React component that provides smooth scrolling behavior when navigating between different sections of a webpage. It enhances the user experience by adding a visually pleasing transition effect.
- [Web Vitals](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#readme): A library that helps measure and report essential web performance metrics. It provides insights into key performance indicators like loading times, interactivity, and visual stability, helping developers optimize their websites for a better user experience.
Sass:
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/): Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins to make styling more maintainable and efficient.
